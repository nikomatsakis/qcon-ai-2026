# Rust has been on a roll lately

But two main things hold us back:

* "Rewrites are expensive, interop is hard"

--
* "Learning curve"

---

# Lately... things look a bit different

> My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI *and* Algorithms to **rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases**. Our North Star is “1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code”.<br>

---

# *Really* different

> If you’ve already tried Rust and found the learning curve too steep, give it another try with Claude Code or Codex as your pair programmer. **The experience is different when you have an AI that can navigate ownership and borrowing patterns** while you focus on building things.<br>
> <br>
> The tools finally catching up to the promise of the language.<br>

# When using agents...

Pick a language, libraries, etc based not on the code you have now,

but based on the **code you want to maintain going forward**.

# When your slogan is "a stich in time, saves nine" in an agentic world...

# Symposium gives general guidance

* General Rust guidance, e.g.,
    * Use Rust 2024
    * Use `cargo add` to add crates so you get the latest version
    * Run `cargo fmt` after making edits

# Symposium lets you write skills for crates

# Symposium installs skills automatically

* Install hooks:
    * After every tool use, we check for new relevant skills and install them
    * **Result:** After agent runs `cargo add toasty`, it knows how to use it

    * Skills
    * Hooks

* User picks agent

    * Load skills into the right directories for the agent user chose
    * Converts between hook formats

# Conclusions

* If you want something to be amazing:
    * Unleash the ecosystem!

* Symposium aims to take a good thing (Rust + LLMs) and make it **better**:
    * Skills and extensions based on what you use
    * Up-to-date guidance
